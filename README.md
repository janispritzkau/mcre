# mcre

mcre is a stateful proxy for Minecraft. It can be used to connect
to a server and have other clients or bots connecting afterwards.

Most of the code was originally part of a different project of mine
and was reused for mcre. This project is very similar to [ReMinecraft](https://github.com/EmotionalLove/ReMinecraft) with the main difference that mcre is a library, but can be turned into something like ReMinecraft with very little code.

Currently only supports Minecraft 1.12.
